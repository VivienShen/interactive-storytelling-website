Scenes changed (add tooltip, change image order, based on Sehrish's doc):
Intro.html/css
Scene1-1, scene1-2, scene2 html/css
Scene3-1, 3-3 html/css (add titles, switch images, css)
Scene4 html/css
Scene6 html/css (call btn line up still has problem)
Scene7 html/css (need to check if the name change work)
Scene8 html/css (check name change)
Scene9 html/css (bold text doesn’t work)

Add: prologue.html/css (new)
Checked color contrast

I have some problems with scene1-2, where I haven't change the slide bar at the end to click dot to go next, 
because I am afraid of mess up the telescope zoom in, if Doaa could take a look?
Some bold text doesn’t work, I haven't figure out why.
